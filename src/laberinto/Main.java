/**
 The Main class to run the AStar algorithm on a randomly generated maze.
 The class generates a random maze with a specified percentage of obstacles,
 and then runs the AStar algorithm to find a path from the start to the end of the maze.
 If a path is found, it displays the maze with the path marked using a specified path character.
 If no path is found, it displays the original maze and prints a message indicating that no path was found.
